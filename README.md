# The Odin Project - my learning journey 
Welcome to my project repository for The Odin Project!

Although I have some experience in web development, I decided to revisit the fundamentals to reinforce my knowledge and fill any gaps in my self-learning journey. The Odin Project is highly rated, which made it an excellent choice for structured learning.

Please note that the code in this repository is primarily for learning purposes. I am focusing on understanding the concepts and meeting project requirements rather than writing production-level code.
